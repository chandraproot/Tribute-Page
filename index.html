              affiliated to University of Madras in Physics

            <li>
              <strong>1966</strong> - After graduating from the Madras Institute
              of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development
              Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation
              (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist
              after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development
              Service (DRDS).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1969</strong> -In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the
              Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project
              director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which
              successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in
              July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket
              project independently at DRDO in 1965.[1] In 1969, Kalam received
              the government's approval and expanded the programme to include
              more engineers

              these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers under
              Kalam's directorship. Kalam played an integral role convincing the
              Union Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified
              aerospace projects. His research and educational leadership
              brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which
              prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile programme
              under his directorship.

            <li>
              <strong>1992</strong> - Kalam served as the Chief Scientific

              period in which he played an intensive political and technological
              role.

              <strong>1998</strong> - In 1998, along with cardiologist Soma
              Raju, Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent, named the
              "Kalam-Raju Stent". In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet
              computer for health care in rural areas, which was named the

              <strong>2007</strong> - At the end of his term, on 20 June 2007,
              Kalam expressed his willingness to consider a second term in
              office provided there was certainty about his victory in the 2007
              presidential election.[64] However, two days later, he decided not
              to contest the Presidential election again stating that he wanted
              to avoid involving Rashtrapati Bhavan from any political
              processes. He did not have the support of the left parties, Shiv
              Sena and UPA constituents, to receive a renewed mandate

              adjunct at many other academic and research institutions across
              India. He taught information technology at the International
              Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, and technology at
              Banaras Hindu University and Anna University.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>2011</strong> - In 2011, Kalam was criticised by civil
              groups over his stand on the Koodankulam Nuclear Power Plant; he
              supported the establishment of the nuclear power plant and was
              accused of not speaking with the local people. The protesters were
              hostile to his visit as they saw him as a pro-nuclear scientist
              and were unimpressed by the assurances he provided regarding the
              safety features of the plant
            </li>
            <li>

              <strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world
              food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are
              the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land.
              Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've
              been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time.
              Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best
              breeds."
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>2015</strong> - On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to
              Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth"
              at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a
              flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort, but was able to
              enter the auditorium after a brief rest. At around 6:35 p.m. IST,
              only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed. He was rushed to
              the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival,
              he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life. Despite being placed
              in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden
              cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m. IST. His last words, to his aide
              Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: "Funny guy! Are you doing
              well?"

            far-reaching contribution that one man's towering intellect,
            persistence and scientific vision can make to human peace and
            progress."</i
